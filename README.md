# Python_API_projects

This folder is basically my collection of Python API projects that I've been working on as I level up my programming skills. It's got all sorts of stuff - weather apps, news scrapers, simple stock trackers, and whatever other API projects I've built along the way. Nothing too fancy, just me learning how to work with different APIs and figuring out how to pull data from various sources.

I'm using this as my go-to spot for dumping all these projects as I build them. Each one taught me something new about handling APIs, whether it was dealing with JSON responses, working with authentication, or just getting comfortable with making HTTP requests in Python. It's pretty cool to see how I've progressed from basic API calls to building more useful applications. I'll keep adding new projects here as I discover more interesting APIs to play around with.

P.S. -  the zipped folders are projects too big for a normal Github upload
